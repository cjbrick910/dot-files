# dot-files

This is a repository with my most used configuration files and scripts needed to get a good customized setup running.

Here's what this includes:
* .bashrc - my customized bash prompt
* .xinitrc - starting i3 (though I mainly use lxdm now)
* .emacs - my main emacs config (does not include theme)
* .Xresources - set xterm color defaults (light blue on black)
* .conky-i3 - configuring conky to work with the i3 bar
* scripts/ - startup scripts (includes folder for i3 that has script needed for conky)
* .config/ - my i3 and i3status configs
* .gkrellm2/ - my gkrellm config (which is obsolete now that I'm using i3)
* termux.properties - my termux config (for my phone's terminal emulator)
